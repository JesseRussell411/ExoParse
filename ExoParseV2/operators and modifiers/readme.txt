what is a "symbolized" object? It's what is comonly refered to simply as an "operator". I found operator to be insuficient, however, because this includes both 1 + 2 and -a. The first example combines 2 elements while the second just modifers 1 element. I've decided to call the first example an "operator" and the second a "modifier".
Operator: A+B
Modifier: -A
